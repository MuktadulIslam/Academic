When a mother and her children first arrive, we check that their circumstances meet our admission criteria, and if
necessary our social workers visit their village or relatives to ensure that they are truly in need. Once the family
has been accepted, they spend a week or so in our clinic so that any illnesses or contagious skin problems such as
scabies are diagnosed and cleared. Immediately on admission, the mother meets with our occupational therapists and
sets up an agreed rehabilitation plan, centred around where she wants to live when she leaves Sreepur Village and
what she would like to do to earn a living, such as agriculture, tailoring, etc. This plan sets out the sections
where the mother will work during her time with us, and the literacy, numeracy and hygiene training that she will
receive.
